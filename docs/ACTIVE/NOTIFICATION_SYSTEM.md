## Overview

Replace the current "moves since progress" warning system with a conservative, three-tier notification system that distinguishes between normal play, concerning patterns, and confirmed unwinnable games.

### Key Principles Applied

1. **Signal Over Noise:** Notifications only when actionable
2. **Conservative Detection:** Better to miss than to nag
3. **User Control:** Can be disabled in Settings
4. **Clear Hierarchy:** Modal for confirmed, toast for concern
5. **Distinguish from Hints:** System detection vs user request

---

## Three-Tier Detection System

### Tier 0: Normal Play
**State:** Player making productive moves OR cycling with purpose
**UX:** Nothing shown
**Exit Condition:** 3+ unproductive cycles detected

### Tier 1: Concern
**State:** Suspicious pattern (cycling without foundation progress)
**UX:** Subtle hint (optional, can be disabled)
**Entry:** 3 unproductive cycles
**Exit:** Productive move made OR escalate to Tier 2

### Tier 2: Warning
**State:** Likely stuck (5+ unproductive cycles)
**UX:** Toast notification with suggestions
**Entry:** 5 unproductive cycles
**Exit:** Productive move made OR escalate to Tier 3

### Tier 3: Confirmed Unwinnable
**State:** Mathematically proven unwinnable
**UX:** Modal with clear actions
**Entry:** Exhaustive search confirms no win path
**Exit:** User selects action (new deal, undo, etc.)

---

## What Counts as "Progress"

Current (incorrect): Only foundation cards

**New Definition (productive moves):**
- [x] Card placed on foundation
- [x] Face-down card revealed
- [x] Valid sequence created in tableau (3+ cards)
- [x] Card moved to empty column (Ace/King)
- [x] Pocket card played (not stored)

**Does NOT count (neutral):**
- Stock draw
- Waste cycle
- Tableau reorganization (no new sequences)
- Pocket storage

**Unproductive (counts against):**
- Full stock/waste cycle with no productive moves
- Returning to previous state with no progress

---

## Detection Algorithm

### Enhanced State Fingerprint

```javascript
{
  // Existing
  tableauHash: string,
  stockWasteHash: string,  // Combined stock + waste
  foundationCount: number,
  
  // New
  faceDownCount: number,           // Total face-down cards
  validSequences: number,          // 3+ card sequences in tableau
  emptyColumns: number,            // Available for Aces/Kings
  
  // Derived
  progressScore: number            // Composite metric
}
```

### Unproductive Cycle Detection

```javascript
function isUnproductiveCycle(previousState, currentState) {
  // Check 1: Did foundation count increase?
  if (currentState.foundationCount > previousState.foundationCount) {
    return false; // Productive
  }
  
  // Check 2: Did face-down count decrease?
  if (currentState.faceDownCount < previousState.faceDownCount) {
    return false; // Productive (revealed card)
  }
  
  // Check 3: Did valid sequences increase?
  if (currentState.validSequences > previousState.validSequences) {
    return false; // Productive
  }
  
  // Check 4: Did empty column get filled strategically?
  if (currentState.emptyColumns < previousState.emptyColumns) {
    // Check if it was Ace or King
    if (wasStrategicColumnFill(previousState, currentState)) {
      return false; // Productive
    }
  }
  
  // No productive changes detected
  return true;
}
```

### Unwinnable Detection (Conservative)

```javascript
function isGameUnwinnable(gameState, searchDepth = 5) {
  // Quick checks first
  
  // 1. Can any card reach foundation?
  const canReachFoundation = checkFoundationReachability(gameState);
  if (!canReachFoundation) {
    return { unwinnable: true, confidence: 'high', reason: 'blocked' };
  }
  
  // 2. Are there circular dependencies?
  const hasCircularBlock = checkCircularDependencies(gameState);
  if (hasCircularBlock) {
    return { unwinnable: true, confidence: 'high', reason: 'circular' };
  }
  
  // 3. Exhaustive search (limited depth for performance)
  const searchResult = exhaustiveSearch(gameState, searchDepth);
  if (searchResult.exhausted && !searchResult.winFound) {
    return { unwinnable: true, confidence: 'medium', reason: 'exhausted' };
  }
  
  // 4. User behavior check (last resort)
  // If user has cycled 10+ times with our detection active
  // and we've detected no progress, high confidence
  
  return { unwinnable: false };
}
```

### Phase 5: Remove Old UI

**Files:**
- `src/components/GameStats/GameStats.jsx` - Remove warning indicator

**Tasks:**
1. Remove circularPlayState warning from stats bar
2. Keep stats (moves, time) - just remove warning text

### Phase 6: Testing & Tuning

**Tasks:**
1. Test with 20+ games
2. Tune thresholds (target: <5% false positive)
3. Verify all tiers work correctly
4. Test settings toggle

---

## Thresholds (Initial)

| Metric | Tier 1 | Tier 2 | Tier 3 |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Unproductive cycles | 3 | 5 | 10+ |
| Moves without progress | — | 30 | 50+ |
| Search confidence | — | — | Medium+ |

**Note:** These are STARTING values. Adjust based on testing.

---

## Migration from Current System

### Current Behavior → New Behavior

| Scenario | Current | New |
|----------|---------|-----|
| Active play, cycling stock | "[Data] 18 moves" warning | Nothing (Tier 0) |
| Cycling 5+ times no progress | "[Warning] Circular play" | Toast suggestion (Tier 2) |
| Unwinnable detected | Nothing | Modal (Tier 3) |
| Notifications disabled | Same warnings | Nothing shown |

### Backward Compatibility

- Existing `circularPlayState` prop remains (for now)
- Can be deprecated after transition
- No breaking changes to game logic

---

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative
- False positive rate: <5%
- False negative rate: <2%
- Time to detect unwinnable: <60 seconds of pointless cycling
- User engagement: 80%+ use suggested action when shown Tier 3

### Qualitative
- Users report understanding when game is unwinnable
- Users don't feel "nagged" during normal play
- Settings toggle is discoverable and used

---

## Open Questions (Decided)

| Question | Decision |
|----------|----------|
| Remove from stats bar? | **Yes.** Use toast/modal only. |
| Conservative vs aggressive? | **Conservative.** Fewer false positives. |
| Allow disabling? | **Yes.** Three options: On/Minimal/Off. |
| Tier 1 optional? | **Yes.** Default OFF to reduce noise. |

## Appendix A: Historical Review & Analysis

**Original Review Date:** January 2026  
**Source:** Consolidated from `NOTIFICATION_SYSTEM_REVIEW.md`

### Problems Identified in Original System

#### Detection Logic Issues

1. **"Progress" only counted foundation cards**
   - Did NOT consider: tableau builds, face-down reveals, sequence creation
   - Result: User could be actively playing well but get "stalled" warning

2. **"Cycles" counted every state repeat**
   - Returns to same tableau arrangement = cycle
   - But stock/waste might have changed, creating new opportunities
   - Result: False circular play detection during normal cycling

3. **Thresholds were too aggressive**
   - 15 moves without foundation placement = caution
   - 20 moves = stalled
   - In a complex game, 20 moves without foundation is NORMAL

#### UI Presentation Issues

1. **Small text in stats bar**
   - Easy to miss during active play

2. **No visual hierarchy**
   - Same presentation for caution/critical/stalled
   - No progressive escalation

3. **No action suggestions**
   - Just tells user there's a problem
   - Doesn't suggest: undo, hint, forfeit options

### Test Scenarios Analysis

| Scenario | User Action | Current Detection | Problem |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|---------|
| Active Play (False Positive) | Cycling stock to find playable card | Warning after 15-20 moves | User IS making progress (revealing cards) |
| Unwinnable Game (False Negative) | Cycling stock repeatedly | No warning | Game is unwinnable but no clear indication |
| Circular Play (True Positive) | Recycling stock 3+ times with no changes | "Circular play" warning | Working correctly, but UX could be better |

### Solutions Implemented

| Issue | Solution | Status |
|-------|----------|--------|
| False positives | Enhanced "progress" definition (6 types of productive moves) | [x] Implemented |
| False negatives | Unwinnable detection with BFS solver | [x] Implemented |
| Poor visibility | Progressive toast → overlay → modal system | [x] Implemented |
| No guidance | Clear action buttons in each tier | [x] Implemented |

### Threshold Evolution

| Tier | Original | Current | Rationale |
|------|----------|---------|-----------|
| Hint | 15 moves | 2 cycles | Earlier subtle indicator |
| Concern | 20 moves | 4 cycles | Reduced false positives |
| Warning | 3 cycles | 6 cycles | More tolerance for cycling |
| Confirmed | N/A | Solver-based | Mathematical certainty |
