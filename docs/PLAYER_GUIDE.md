## Game Overview

### Objective

Move all 52 cards to the **foundation piles** (the four slots at the top) to win the game.

### The Playing Field

| Area | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Stock** | The pile of face-down cards in the top-left. Click to draw cards. |
| **Waste** | The face-up pile next to stock. Top card is always playable. |
| **Pocket** | Two special slots for temporary card storage. |
| **Tableau** | The main playing area with 8 columns of cards. |
| **Foundations** | Four slots at the top where you build winning piles. |

### Card Arrangement

**Tableau Columns:** The game starts with cards dealt into 8 columns. Some cards are face-down (covered), others are face-up (playable). Face-down cards become available when the cards on top of them are moved.

**Foundations:** Build these from Ace → King (Ace low). Each foundation holds one suit.

## How to Play

### Basic Controls

| Action | Mouse | Touch | Keyboard |
|--------|-------|-------|----------|
| Draw Card | Click Stock | Tap Stock | Spacebar |
| Move Card | Drag & Drop | Drag & Drop | Arrow keys + Enter |
| Auto-Play | Double-click card | Double-tap card | A key |
| Undo | Button or Ctrl+Z | Button | Ctrl+Z |
| Hint | Button or H key | Button | H key |
| Pause | Escape | Pause button | Escape |

### Making Moves

#### 1. Tableau to Tableau

Move cards between columns following these rules:

- **Descending order:** Cards must be placed on a card exactly one rank higher
- **Alternating colors:** Red cards on black cards, black cards on red cards
- **Sequences:** You can move multiple cards together if they're in sequence
- **Empty columns:** Any card or sequence can be placed on empty columns

**Example:** You can place a red 7 on a black 8. You can move a sequence of 5♠-4♥-3♣ together onto a 6♦.

#### 2. Tableau to Foundation

Build foundation piles from Ace upward:

- Start each foundation with an **Ace**
- Build up by rank: A → 2 → 3 → ... → Q → K
- **Same suit required:** Hearts on hearts, spades on spades, etc.

**Pro Tip:** Double-click any card that can legally move to foundation - it will auto-play there instantly!

#### 3. Stock and Waste

- Click the **Stock** to draw a card face-up to the **Waste** pile
- The top card of the Waste is always playable
- When Stock is empty, click it again to recycle the Waste pile

**Hidden Modes:** In "Hidden" game modes, the Stock is limited - you can only recycle it a few times!

#### 4. Using the Pocket

The **Pocket** (two slots above the stock) provides temporary storage:

- Place any single card in an empty pocket slot
- Retrieve pocket cards anytime
- Useful for freeing up cards buried in the tableau

### Special Column Types

| Column Type | Marked By | Build Direction | Special Rule |
|-------------|-----------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Ace Column** | Light badge | Up (A→6) | Can only start with Ace |
| **King Column** | Dark badge | Down (K→7) | Can only start with King |
| **Traditional** | No badge | Either direction | Flexible placement |

## Strategy Guide

### Beginner Strategies

#### 1. Expose Face-Down Cards First

Your priority should always be revealing hidden cards. Cards you can't see are cards you can't play!

**Priority order:**
1. Moves that reveal face-down cards
2. Moves that free up Aces for foundations
3. Moves that create empty columns

#### 2. Build Foundations Early

- Place Aces on foundations as soon as you find them
- Build up foundations steadily
- Don't be afraid to move cards to foundations - they're safe there!

#### 3. Create Empty Columns

Empty columns are **incredibly valuable**:
- They act as temporary storage
- They let you move sequences between columns
- They free up buried cards

#### 4. Use the Pocket Wisely

- Store cards that are blocking important moves
- Don't fill both pockets unless necessary
- Remember what's in your pockets!

### Intermediate Strategies

#### 5. Plan Several Moves Ahead

Before making a move, ask:
- What does this reveal?
- What does this block?
- Can I make a better move after a different move?

#### 6. Sequence Building

Sometimes it's better to keep cards in the tableau rather than moving them to foundations:
- Sequences can be moved as units to empty columns
- Long sequences give you more flexibility
- Don't break up useful sequences unnecessarily

#### 7. Suit Management

Pay attention to which suits are well-represented:
- If you have many hearts, prioritize heart foundation building
- Balance your foundation growth - don't let one suit lag too far behind

### Advanced Strategies

#### 8. Column Type Optimization

**Ace Columns:**
- Ideal for building long upward sequences
- Don't block them with cards that can't build on Aces

**King Columns:**
- Perfect for storing high cards
- Build downward sequences to consolidate cards

**Traditional Columns:**
- Your most flexible resource
- Use for temporary maneuvering

#### 9. Stock Management (Hidden Modes)

When recycling is limited:
- **Count your passes** through the stock
- **Memorize** card positions as you cycle through
- **Plan** which cards you need before recycling
- **Don't waste** recycles on minor moves

#### 10. Endgame Efficiency

When you have few cards remaining:
- Use the auto-complete feature (if available)
- Minimize moves - each unnecessary move affects your score
- Don't undo winning moves!
